Yes, you can take a project that uses the MIT license, make modifications to it, and then release your modified version under the AGPL-3.0 license. However, there are a few important points to consider:

1. **MIT License Permissions**:  
   The MIT license is permissive, meaning it allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, even in projects that use a different license.

2. **Relicensing**:  
   When you modify an MIT-licensed project and want to relicense it under AGPL-3.0, you can do so for the modifications you've made. The AGPL-3.0 license is a copyleft license, which requires that the modified source code (and any derivatives) be made available under the same AGPL-3.0 license.

3. **Original License Notice**:  
   You must retain the original MIT license notice in any files where it appears, even if you are relicensing the project under AGPL-3.0. This ensures that the original authors are credited according to the terms of the MIT license.

4. **Compatibility Considerations**:  
   While the AGPL-3.0 license is more restrictive than the MIT license, this is allowed as long as you follow the conditions mentioned above. Anyone using your modified version will need to comply with the AGPL-3.0 terms.

In summary, you can modify an MIT-licensed project and release your modified version under AGPL-3.0, but you must ensure that you respect the terms of the original MIT license and include the necessary license notices.
